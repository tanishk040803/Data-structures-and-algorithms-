📘 DSA Learning Journey

🚀 About

This repository contains all the problems and concepts I’ve learned while practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++.
I am using this repo as my personal DSA notebook to track progress and revise important problems.

⸻

📂 Structure
	•	Arrays/ → Basics, searching, sorting problems
	•	Recursion/ → Recursive functions, backtracking
	•	Binary Search/ → Classic problems (Book Allocation, Painters Partition, Koko Eating Bananas, Aggressive Cows, etc.)
	•	Pointers/ → Basics and applications with arrays
	•	2D Arrays/ → Matrix traversal, rotation, etc.
	•	Patterns/ → Number/star pattern problems

⸻

✅ What I’ve Learned So Far
	•	🔹 Basics of C++ (loops, arrays, functions, pointers)
	•	🔹 Pattern printing
	•	🔹 1D & 2D Arrays (searching, rotation, manipulation)
	•	🔹 Recursion (factorial, Fibonacci, power, printing numbers, sum problems, optimized recursion)
	•	🔹 Binary Search and its applications (First & Last occurrence, Floor & Ceiling, Mountain Array, Single Element in Sorted Array, Book Allocation, Painter’s Partition, Aggressive Cows, Koko Eating Bananas)
	•	🔹 Sorting (Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort)

⸻

📈 Roadmap
	•	🟢 Complete all Striver’s DSA Sheet problems
	•	🟢 Revise Recursion & Binary Search
	•	🟡 Move into Linked List, Stack, Queue
	•	🟡 Start Trees & Graphs after mastering basics
	•	🔴 Regularly push solved problems

 
📌 Notes

I am continuously updating this repo as I learn new topics. Feel free to fork, star ⭐, or suggest improvements!
